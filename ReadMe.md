        <strong>
            Destiny War
        </strong> 
        is an NFT based play-to-earn MMORPG game on BSC. You get yourself a Character/Warrior, a mount , and a pet and go in battles. Send your Mount and Pet and gather materials needed for crafting. The higher your level the greater the chance to earn more $DWAR tokens. You can also breed to create more warriors, build guilds and siege castles for higher rewards. We are players and we basically created a game that we ourselves wanted to play.

        *Play And Earn.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's so many click to earn games, and we wanted to give our players a chance to really play games and be excited about it. Destiny war gives that nostalgic feel of the old MMORPG games.

    <p>
        *We Want to make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan on giving back 10% to the community through our Charity fund. Our players are our partners, so they will have the right to vote where this fund will go to.
    </p>
    <p>
        *We will strive to create and maintain a good Economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it's true there is no perfect economy, we have put it in burning mechanisms in crafting and breeding. We have also included buyback and burns in our tokenomics should the need arise. Rest assured that we won't stop learning and we will be watching closely to monitor and adopt in different circumstances.
